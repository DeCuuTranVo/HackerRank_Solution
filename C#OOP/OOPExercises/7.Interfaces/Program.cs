﻿/*
Create a C# program that implements an 

IVehiculo interface 
    with two methods, one for 
        Drive of type void and another for 
        Refuel of type bool that has a parameter of type integer with the amount of gasoline to refuel. 
        
Then create a Car class with a 
    builder that receives a parameter with the car's starting gasoline amount and
    implements the Drive and Refuel methods of the car.

The Drive method will print on the screen that the car is Driving, if the gasoline is greater than 0. T
he Refuel method will increase the gasoline of the car and return true.

To carry out the tests, 
    create an object of type Car with 0 of gasoline in the Main of the program and 
    ask the user for an amount of gasoline to refuel, 
    finally execute the Drive method of the car.
